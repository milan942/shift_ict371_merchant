5. set a date and time to go to Nathan's office  -Tuesday 1:30pm-3:30Pm
6. Blogs - due tomorrow
7. Project proposal - put sprints in now?


## Saturday 24 May scrum (sprint start)  - data import

### to do | done:

(+) excel import 
(-) is.na, is_empty checkpoints for missing data cells
(-) string processing (get rid of special characters, white space?)
(+) dates import - probably don't need them in day-month-year formats, month seems to isolate fine

+ project proposal 
	intro, problem statement... ? <- update here...

### Questions and points for the second client meeting

0. timeframes, expectations, etc - to confirm expected type of deliveries and the frame of work
1. the current output OK as it is (as in what  Nathan showed us), or needs tweeking or improving?
2. if not, what is missing from the current reports
3. Couplands - are we right in assuming the reports come month by month? what happens if I try to generate a report for Feb in May?
can we assume the files will stay in a separate folder?


## Questions (first client meeting):

1. Who are generating reports (one person, several?)
	so far, only Nathan himself
2. What system are they using (Mac | Win | other?)
	Win Excel with a hint of PowerBI
3. What analysis software is involved (Excel? SPSS? web-based?)
	Excel, probably PowerBI (to what extent was that macros written, unclear)
4. Where do the input files come from? Are they downloadable? What formats (docx, xlsx, txt, csv?)
	supplied by N's clients. The format is dictated by a particular reporting system. Couplands:  month-by-month aggregated tables of daily transactions and summaries, with a separate file for each traiding location. CSV files have uniform names (date-Westpac_Merchant_Statements_ID_..etc.csv)

5. Can Nathan do a tour (show us a sample project?)
	Data received, an office visit TBC
6. Time constraints: how fast is the data turnaround?
	3-4 weeks per client, right?
7. Preffered output ideas
	pivot tables, before|ater tables, looking for some visualisation suggestions
