1. excel import functions (on dummy data)
2. is.na, is_empty checkpoints for missing data cells
3. string processing (get rid of special characters, white space?)
4. fokking dates!!!!

## Questions:

1. Who are generating reports (one person, several?)
2. What system are they using (Mac | Win | other?)
3. What analysis software is involved (Excel? SPSS? web-based?)
4. Where do the input files come from? Are they downloadable? What formats (docx, xlsx, txt, csv?)
5. Can Nathan do a tour (show us a sample project?)
6. Time constraints: how fast is the data turnaround?
7. Preffered output ideas
