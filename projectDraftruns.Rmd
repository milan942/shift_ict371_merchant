```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(openxlsx)
library(readxl)
```

## readxl

col_types = c("text", "text",	"date",	"text",	"text",	"numeric",	"numeric",	"numeric",	"numeric",	"numeric", "numeric",	"numeric",	"numeric")
```{r}

xlsxFile<-"20210503_Westpac_Merchant_Statements_332259464_00000_1_23772.xlsx"
a<- read_excel(xlsxFile, sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE, skip = 8, trim_ws = TRUE)
transaction_id<-c("TDESD")
```

```{r}
head(a)
```

Note that something strange is going on in the row 2 (Sales Amount, etc), but it is consistent result for both openxlsx::read.xls and  readxl::read_excel. There are similar rows downstream as well. We might use round(x, digits = 2), just have to check that it does not change cents amount and create discrepancy in the total sums

## openxlsx
```{r}
xlsxFile<-"20210503_Westpac_Merchant_Statements_332259464_00000_1_23772.xlsx"
b<-read.xlsx(xlsxFile, sheet = 1, startRow = 9, cols = c(1:10), na.strings = "NA", colNames = TRUE, skipEmptyCols = TRUE, detectDates = TRUE)
b$Date<-convertToDate(b$Date)
```

with convertToDate() dates entered in the format "12/4/2021" would have been read in correctly, those that are "13/04" are turned into NAs. Different formats are an artifact created by Excel in attempt to americanise the date format (it believes that first two digits are a month number and things go strange starting from the 13th day of each month)


## reading csv data

### reading the file names in the directory

```{r}
dir<-"./data/Couplands_data_April_2021/"
files_to_read<-list.files(dir)
files_to_read[1]

```

### reading a csv file in - header, date
getting the business site name and date of the report

```{r}
a<-read.csv(file = paste0(dir, files_to_read[1]), header = F, nrows = 8) # read the header - first 8 rows
site_address<-a[1, c(6,7)] # get the address
d<-read.csv(file = paste0(dir, files_to_read[1]), header = T, skip = 8)
dates<- d %>% filter(TDESH %in% "TDESD") %>% select(Date) %>% .[["Date"]]# 'TDESD' seems to be the code for day-by-day transactions, col 3 has dates in dd/mm format
dates_s<-strsplit(as.character(dates), "/") # split the vector of dates by '/'. strisplit() outputs a list, every second sub-element is the month
month<-sapply(dates_s, "[[", 2) # something clever we have to credit mighty web for, gets every second sub-element of the list 
#month<-unique(sort(month)) # sort and get unique values
# if after sorting the month is of length 1 - it is all good and we can set it as a report date
```

## get the data to collate into further reports

### variable names

Var names come from the first row with 'IDMH' code ('H' for header?)

!!! check if 'IDMH'  appears once per spreadsheet. So far it is hard-coded that we take the first appearance of 'IDMH' as col names for the data

Note: the thing about conversion factors to strings is ![here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2851015/convert-data-frame-columns-from-factors-to-characters)

```{r}
data_col_names<-d[d$TDESH == "IDMH", ]
data_col_names<- data_col_names %>% mutate_if(is.factor, as.character) %>% gsub(" ", ".", .) 

```

select the data with 'IDMDT' as a code

```{r}
d_to_integrate<-d[d$TDESH %in% "IDMDT", ]
colnames(d_to_integrate)<-data_col_names
```


looping over files in the directory

```{r}
list_of_data_to_integrate<-list()
list_of_dates<-list()
list_of_address<-list()
for (i in 1:length(files_to_read)){
  a<-read.csv(file = paste0(dir, files_to_read[i]), header = F, nrows = 8) # read the header - first 8 rows
list_of_address[[i]]<-a[1, c(6,7)] # get the address
d<-read.csv(file = paste0(dir, files_to_read[i]), header = T, skip = 8)
dates<-d %>% filter(TDESH %in% "TDESD") %>% select(Date) %>% .[["Date"]] # 'TDESD' seems to be the code for day-by-day transactions, col 3 has dates in dd/mm format
dates_s<-strsplit(as.character(dates), "/") # split the vector of dates by '/'. strisplit() outputs a list, every second sub-element is the month
month<-sapply(dates_s, "[[", 2) # something clever we have to credit mighty web for, gets every second sub-element of the list 
list_of_dates[[i]]<-unique(sort(month)) # sort and get unique values
# if after sorting the month is of length 1 - it is all good and we can set it as a report date

data_col_names<-d[d$TDESH == "IDMH", ]
data_col_names<- data_col_names %>% mutate_if(is.factor, as.character) %>% gsub(" ", ".", .) 
d_to_integrate<-d[d$TDESH %in% "IDMDT", ]
colnames(d_to_integrate)<-data_col_names
list_of_data_to_integrate[[i]]<-d_to_integrate
}
```












## Stdin

you would have to type in the file name in the console pane:

![console  pane ](images/stdin.png)




```{r}
cat("What's your file name? ")
x <- readLines(con=stdin(),1)
print(x)
```
