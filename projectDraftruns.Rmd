## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Stdin

you would have to type in the file name in the console pane:

![console  pane ](images/stdin.png)




```{r}
cat("What's your file name? ")
x <- readLines(con=stdin(),1)
print(x)
```


## Sample data

Read in:
```{r}
data<-read.csv("sample_file2.csv", header = T)
```

Some data wrangling:

```{r}
data$Quantity<-sample(0:25, nrow(data), replace = TRUE)
data$Total.Charge<-data$Quantity * data$Full.cost.unit
data_sort_by_unit_price<-data[order(data$Unit.Price.Charged),]
```


Simple plot:

```{r}
d<-data_sort_by_unit_price
plot(d$Unit.Price.Charged, d$Quantity, pch = 15, col = "red", main = "Number of kits Puchased", ylab = "Quantity", xlab = "Price per unit")
```
